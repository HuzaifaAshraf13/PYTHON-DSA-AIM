Issue With array : if capacity is 5 when it exceed the program will alocate n*2 space in memory
 Array stores elements at contious memory location
 Linkned list stores them at diffrent location ecah pointer points to the next element
 in case of insertion just modify the link and it will create space for 1 element instead n*2

  #Insert element at begining O(1)
  Delete element at begining O(1)
  insert delete element at the end O(n) cause you have to iterate through  list
   LINKED LIST TRANSVERSAL AND ACCESING ELEMENT BY VALUE O(n)
BENIFITS    You don't need to allocate space alocate whenever it needed + insertion becomes easy
DOULBLE LINKED LIST
 IN this the element has not only adress of next element but also the previous ones
