DEFINE
How the rruning time and space of a program grows as the input grows

time linear prorpotion to size
time = a*n
def foo(a):
size(arr)-> 100 -> 0.22 millisecond
size(arr) -> 1000-> 0.23 millisecond

in that case time is almost constant and represaented by
constatnt function is represented by
time = a
so as the time is constant the time colpexity is
o(1)
